# numGuesser
A game that allows users to guess a number between 1 and 15 
JavaScript keeps getting more interesting every day! I recently delved deep into the JS DOM and developed a number guessing game. The game challenges users to guess a number between 1 and 15 within seven attempts. This project helped me learn how to structure code using functions, utilize conditionals, and make use of the Math.random() method provided by the window object.
The game includes the following functionalities: An input field for users to enter their guesses. A button that triggers a click or mousedown event to validate the input value. A reload/play-again function to start a new game. A set message function that displays the outcome of the user's guess below the UI.
